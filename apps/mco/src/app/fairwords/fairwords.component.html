<h1>MCO</h1>
<p>Let's pretend that the page container for the iframe is MCO and the iframe will display the content from another angular project (also pretending to be Fairwords). The iframe has a border just to make clear its content area.</p>
<section class="container">
  <iframe
    [src]="src"
    mcoIframe
    [acceptedDomain]="fairwordsDomain"
    (dataReceived)="handleNavigation($event)"
  ></iframe>
</section>
